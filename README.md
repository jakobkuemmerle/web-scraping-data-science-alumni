# web-scraping-data-science-alumni

## Idea
This is a personal fun project. We want to scrape the data of alumni in the MLDS (previous MSIA) Masters program of Northwestern University. The findings should highlight the diversity of past students and their most prevalent Career Paths after graduation.

## Data Preparation
Each MLDS student has a profil with some basic information and contact details on the Homepage of Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering. We scrape the data using Beautiful Soup in Python and deal with different data cleaning issues. Then we transform the data to pandas dataframe and perform basic EDA. Subsequently we focus on 2 use cases and start analysis.

## Findings
